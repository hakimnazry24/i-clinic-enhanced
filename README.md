# **INTRODUCTION**

The i-Clinic website is designed to facilitate healthcare delivery and offer a more convenient service to the students, staffs and patients. Previously, patients needed to walk in and often waited for long periods to receive treatment. Patients were also challenged to obtain timely information, such as about doctors' unavailability. Moreover, patient data was not recorded correctly since they had to do so through Google forms without a procedure to record the history of treatments for a subsequent use.This website aims to address these challenges. It consists of a clinically relevant, web-based scheduling and appointment which is accessible to patients for booking, rescheduling, and cancelling appointments. An effective medical record management system, which will secure access and update for patients as well as clinic staff. The website will have a billing and payment system in order to facilitate payment of bills easily, and it will ensure the timely information concerning the operations of clinic, hours of operation, and news. The aim of this project is to optimize clinic work processes as well as decrease waiting times and provide a more structured, reliable health service.

The **Medical Record** page provides authorized doctors with secure access to their patients' medical histories. Through this page, doctors can view detailed records including previous diagnoses, treatments, medications, allergies, and other relevant health information. The page is designed to ensure that doctors have quick and organized access to important patient data, enabling them to make informed decisions during consultations. Access to this page will be restricted to authorized personnel only, with proper authentication protocols in place to protect patient privacy and data security. This feature streamlines patient care by providing doctors with comprehensive medical histories in a digital format. Doctors have the ability to **add new medical records** for ongoing visits, including notes about symptoms, diagnoses, and treatment plans. Additionally, they can **update existing records** to reflect any changes in the patient's condition or treatment. This system ensures that patient information is easily accessible, up-to-date, and securely stored, helping doctors provide better care while maintaining accurate medical histories.

## **Challenge or difficulties to develop website**
Making the i-Clinic website was not easy and came with many challenges. Fixing errors in the code and debugging problems took a lot of time and effort. We had to ensure all buttons, like booking or canceling appointments, worked properly and connected to the system. Managing the database was tricky because we needed to design and test it carefully to store medical records, appointments, and user details without losing any data. Designing a simple and responsive website was also hard, as it had to be easy for everyone, including students and staff, to use. Lastly, combining all the parts, like booking appointments, managing medical records, and collecting feedback, into one smooth and working system was a big challenge.
